  <span class="FAQ Question">
     I registered as an organ donor before December 2016 and have an ORGAN DONOR CARD. Is this still valid and does it mean I am still registered as an organ donor?
 </span>

 <span>NO. If you registered as an organ donor before December 2016 and have an ORGAN DONOR CARD you have to register again. Due to the absence of a legislative framework the data collected before December 2016 could not be stored. We now have the National Human Organ and Tissue Donation Register according to the provisions of the Human Organs, Tissues And Cell Donation Act, Chapter 558, and all Data is processed and stored according to the Data Protection Act.
